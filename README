======================================

Project requirements
--------------------
Fresh Tomatoes shows a list of movies on a web-page
When you click on a movie, it pulls up the trailer for the movie


Project enhancements
--------------------

Implemented link to IMDb using IMDbpy package.  Was able to 
pull in cover art to show in web page rather than hard coding
a link.  

Also was able to access IMDBid id using IMDbpy and that enabled
me to create a link to the appropriate IMDb movie page when you
click on the title of the movie. 

Trailer links are not included in the IMDb database so I had to 
store those in an array.  Used a dictionary to store each movie's
name and trailer URL and stored those dictionaries in a list.

Other changes to fresh_tomatoes.ph
----------------------------------

I was having an issue where any movie with more than one line of
title was pushing the movie below it to the right and leaving a
blank space.  I set the height to be fixed and that seems to have
resolved the issue.

 .col-md-4 {
            height: 450px;
        }
        
Added a div to so I could have a link to the trailer and a link
to IMDB.
